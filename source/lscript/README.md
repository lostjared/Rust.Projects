Another project to practice

Write down in a text file the movements you want the pixel to take
the program will interpret the file and move the pixel in the direction
specified in the text file. A few example scripts are in the scripts/ directory.

L stands for move Left
R stands for move Right
D stands for move Down
U stands for move Up

the formst is Direction:Steps

so

	R:1
	D:1
	L:1
	U:1

is to move in a square by 1 movement each iteration
