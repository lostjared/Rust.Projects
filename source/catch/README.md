Simple Game of Catch (No Graphics w/ SDL2).

Press Left and Right arrow keys to move the catcher, and the objects
are thrown from the top of the screen. Catch them before they hit the bottom of the screen, miss 10 and have to start over.

To Compile this on Windows you need to download SDL2_ttf from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases
and set the proper path before compiling with cargo. Then copy SDL2_ttf.dll into the target directory.
