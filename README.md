# Practice Rust.Projects

I am developing several projects as a means to deepen my understanding of the Rust programming language. Beginning with straightforward tasks, I am progressively tackling more complex concepts inherent to Rust.

My collection of projects encompasses a console application, a selection of basic games, various command-line utilities, and a handful of libraries. Additionally, I've included samples demonstrating Rust's language features and specific implementation techniques to aid in retention and recall.

For those running the compiled examples on Windows, available in the release section, please note that the Microsoft Visual Studio Runtime is required. This can be obtained directly from Microsoft.

Rust, known for its focus on safety and performance, was first introduced in 2010 by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research. It has since garnered acclaim for its innovative approach to memory management without a garbage collector, and its capacity to empower developers to write fast, safe code effectively. Rust's rich history and its community's commitment to fostering a friendly and inclusive environment only add to my enthusiasm for the language, which I find truly awesome.
