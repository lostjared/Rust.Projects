# Rust.Projects
Projects I am writing to help me learn the Rust programming language.
Starting off simple working my way through the different concepts.

Some of the projects contained are a console, a few simple games,
some command line tools and a few libraries. Also included examples 
of language features and implementation details to help me remember.
