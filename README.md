# Rust.Projects
Projects I am writing to help me learn the Rust programming language.
Starting off simple working my way through the different concepts.

Some of the projects contained are a console, a few simple games,
some command line tools and a few libraries. Also included examples 
of language features and implementation details to help me remember.

You might need to remove the "bundled" string to compile the SDL2 examples on Linux in the Cargo.toml file
